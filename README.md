# StarWarsCharacters

Specification
1)Please build an IPhone app that uses the free STAR WARS api https://swapi.co/

Guidelines
1) shows a list view of all Star Wars characters (people) with their names and eye-color.
2) Add a dynamic control (for example segment control) that filters the list by eye-color of people. This segment control should be scalable for the future, so should automatically show more elements when the api returns more eye-colors some day. Each segment should show the eye color and the amount of people, like:" green (12) "

Additional Requirements
1) Focus on code quality, architecture and efficiency in this exercise
2) Add unit tests

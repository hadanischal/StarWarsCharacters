# StarWarsCharacters

## Requirements:
* iOS 11.0+
* Xcode 10.2.1
* Swift 5.0

## Compatibility
This demo is expected to be run using Swift 5.0 and Xcode 10.2.x.

## Objective:
This is a simple Demo project which aims to demonstate the  Star Wars Characters using MVVM pattern in Swift.
* This project was intended to work as a Star Wars Characters demo projects for iOS using Swift. It has been structured using the MVVM design pattern.
* The demo uses the [Star Wars API](http://swapi.co) as an excuse to have a nice use-case, because querying a WebService API is asynchronous by nature and is thus a good example for showing how It can be useful .

## Specification
*  Please build an IPhone app that uses the free [Star Wars API](http://swapi.co) 

## Guidelines
*  Shows a list view of all Star Wars characters (people) with their names and eye-color.
*  Add a dynamic control (for example segment control) that filters the list by eye-color of people. This segment control should be scalable for the future, so should automatically show more elements when the api returns more eye-colors some day. Each segment should show the eye color and the amount of people, like:" green (12) "

## Additional Requirements
*  Focus on code quality, architecture and efficiency in this exercise
*  Add unit tests
